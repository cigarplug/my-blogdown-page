<p>A long time ago, on December 5, 2015 to be precise, my twitter account was compromised such that each of my followers were sent a tweet containing a different tumblr blog profile. How exactly this happened I haven’t a clue about, but all this spam did leave me perplexed.</p>
<p>Have a look at the following:</p>
<p>{{% tweet "805583628734341122" %}}{{% tweet "805583624011554816" %}}</p>
<p>Sigh. Today, I am going to cleanse it all using the twitter API libraries for R namely: <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rtweet/index.html">rtweet</a> &amp; <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/twitteR/index.html">twitteR</a>. The reason I have used two separate packages is that rtweet, which is newer and a lot more developer friendly compared to twitteR, does not (yet?) seem to provide a method for deleting tweets. I could obviously only use twitteR for this purpose but had already done half the job of obtaing IDs for the tweets in question using the rtweet package.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>my_tweets &lt;- rtweet::get_timeline(&quot;grimyard&quot;, n = 10000, home = T)</code></pre>
<p>This data frame reveals the ids of tweets that I’ve got to delete i.e, row-numbers 110 till 344.
Next, a for loop will fetch and create objects of class status from the tweetR package and delete each of them one-by-one</p>
<pre class="r"><code>for (i in c(110:344)){
  status_obj &lt;- twitteR::showStatus(my_tweets$status_id[i])
  Sys.sleep(1/10)
  resp &lt;- twitteR::deleteStatus(status_obj)
  Sys.sleep(1/10)
  if(isTRUE(resp)){
    print(paste0(&quot;tweet #&quot;, i, &quot; has been deleted&quot;))
  }
}</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;tweet #110 has been deleted&quot;
## [1] &quot;tweet #111 has been deleted&quot;
## [1] &quot;.&quot;
## [1] &quot;.&quot;
## [1] &quot;.&quot;
## [1] &quot;tweet #344 has been deleted&quot;</code></pre>
<p>YES! Looks like our work here is done.</p>
