```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(knitr)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, 
                      echo = TRUE, dpi = 180)
options(width=80, dplyr.width = 150)

```

A long time ago, on December 5, 2015 to be precise, my twitter account was compromised such that each of my followers were sent a tweet containing a different tumblr blog profile. How exactly this happened I haven't a clue about, but all this spam did leave me perplexed.

Have a look at the following:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
blogdown::shortcode('tweet', '805583628734341122')
blogdown::shortcode('tweet', '805583624011554816')
```



Sigh. Today, I am going to cleanse it all using the twitter API libraries for R namely: [rtweet](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rtweet/index.html) & [twitteR](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/twitteR/index.html). The reason I have used two separate packages is that rtweet, which is newer and a lot more developer friendly compared to twitteR, does not (yet?) seem to provide a method for deleting tweets. I could obviously only use twitteR for this purpose but had already done half the job of obtaing IDs for the tweets in question using the rtweet package.



```{r, eval=FALSE}
my_tweets <- rtweet::get_timeline("grimyard", n = 10000, home = T)

```

This data frame reveals the ids of tweets that I've got to delete i.e, row-numbers 110 till 344.
Next, a for loop will fetch and create objects of class status from the tweetR package and delete each of them one-by-one

```{r, eval=FALSE}
for (i in c(110:344)){
  status_obj <- twitteR::showStatus(my_tweets$status_id[i])
  Sys.sleep(1/10)
  resp <- twitteR::deleteStatus(status_obj)
  Sys.sleep(1/10)
  if(isTRUE(resp)){
    print(paste0("tweet #", i, " has been deleted"))
  }
}
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='hold'}
print("tweet #110 has been deleted")
print("tweet #111 has been deleted")
print(".")
print(".")
print(".")
print("tweet #344 has been deleted")
```


YES! Looks like our work here is done.
