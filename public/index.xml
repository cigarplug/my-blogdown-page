      <description>It all started sometime around March or April of 2017. I was sittig at my office desk, working on my laptop when its display abruptly went dark. My first conviction was that somebody in the office managed to pull off a prank by remotely ‘halting’ my system.

      <description>Prologue GSMArena is a gadget review website with a focus on cellular and mobile devices. I believe to have come across the site a long time ago through the now defunct iGoogle start-page.
